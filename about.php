          Launched in 2025, The Silver Journal is a YouTube-channel dedicated to analog photography. Created by Danish photographer and video journalist Mathias Andreasen, the purpose of The Silver Journal is to be a virtual space for inspiration and conversation with a particular attention to the stories told and the art created by means of photography.

        <p class="about-text">
          While my photographs are heavily influenced by having studied documentary filmmaking and working professionally as a reporter; I am still attracted to the fantastical and surreal. Focusing my interest on people and their vibrating trace in urban environments I also look for moments within the neverending ordinary that shimmer with rarity. Glimpses of appearances playfully coming together in an aesthetically interesting fashion.

          I photograph to make compelling pictures, capturing moments of lives lived as they appeared in a fraction of a second.

         While my photographs are heavily influenced by having studied documentary filmmaking and working professionally as a reporter; I am still attracted to the fantastical and surreal. Focusing my interest on people and their vibrating trace in urban environments I also look for moments within the neverending ordinary that shimmer with rarity. Glimpses of appearances playfully coming together in an aesthetically interesting fashion.

         I photograph to make compelling pictures, capturing moments of lives lived as they appeared in a fraction of a second.

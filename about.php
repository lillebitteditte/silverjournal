    Launched in 2025, The Silver Journal is a YouTube-channel dedicated to analog photography. Created by danish photographer and video journalist Mathias Andreasen, the purpose of The Silver Journal is to be a virtual space for inspiration and conversation with a particular attention to the stories told and the art created by means of photography.

   While I appreciate the multitude of possibilities for creating story or art with photography, my own photography is heavily influenced by having studied documentary filmmaking and working professionally as a video journalist for several years. I strive for story; of people and their lived experiences and of environments and their societal footprints. I consider my work an aesthetic archival contribution that – when the photographs are successful – creates a possibility for understanding how life is lived.
